# Registry Process Resources

Schemes use `ib1:Process` resources to describe and uniquely identify data processing activities that have been formally defined through the Scheme's governance process.

As URLs of `ib1:Process` resources are used as identifiers in long-lived data structures, the versioning method used by the Scheme must not change the URLs of these resources.

## RDF Prefixes

This specification uses the following prefixes:

```
  ib1:     https://registry.trust.ib1.org/ns/1.0#
```

## Terms

In addition to the Common Terms defined by the Registry specification, `ib1:Process` resources use the following terms:

`ib1:processDefinition`
: The formal human-readable definition of the Process as a string literal, with Markdown formatting.
