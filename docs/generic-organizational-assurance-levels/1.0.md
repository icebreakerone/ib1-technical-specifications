# Generic Organizational Assurance

Organizational assurability is anchored on identity management and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. The levels also add good data governance practices and are aligned with the [Icebreaker Principles](https://icebreakerone.org/icebreaker-principles/). 

This specification defines generic Organization Assurance Levels, identified by URLs in the IB1 Root Registry with the `https://registry.trust.ib1.org/organization-assurance-level/` prefix.

_Note: This document uses US English. To align with W3C and other prevalent standards, IB1 uses US English in its technical specifications and technical documentation._

## Dependencies
