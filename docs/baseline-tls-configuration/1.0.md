# Baseline TLS Configuration

Servers and clients participating in a Trust Framework must meet minimum standards in their TLS configuration. Other specifications may add further restrictions, but may not make choices which reduce the level of security.


## Machine to machine

All machine to machine connections must use TLS 1.3 or later with server and client certificates issued by the Directory.

Client and server certificates must use ECDSA keys with the secp256r1 (P-256) or secp384r1 (P-384) curves. No wildcard names are permitted in the Subject or Subject Alternative Name extension.

Validity of certificates must be checked, using the algorithms specified in the relevant RFCs and the other Trust Framework specifications used alongside this specification.

DNS for any hostnames used in machine to machine connections should use DNSSEC.


## Directory and Registry

The Directory and Registry must use TLS 1.3 and present a server certificate issued by a public Certificate Authority using a ECDSA key with the secp384r1 (P-384) curve. No wildcard names are permitted.

The Directory and Registry must not require a client certificate.

DNS for any hostnames used by the Directory and Registry must use DNSSEC.



## End user services

End user services, such as the user interface for OAuth Issuers, must use a TLS configuration that is compliant with the Member's written security policy.
