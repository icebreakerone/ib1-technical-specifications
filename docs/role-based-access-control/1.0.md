# Role-based Access Control

Access to data sources is controlled by roles and licenses.

A [Data Catalog Entry](../data-catalog-records/1.0.md) specifies one or more roles and a license. If a participant has any of the roles, they may access the data source under the specified license.

Scheme-conforming data sources use [Scheme Catalog Requirements Resources](../data-catalog-records/1.0.md#scheme-catalog-requirements) which specify the Access Rules for data sources which implement APIs agreed by the Scheme.

_Note: This document uses US English. To align with W3C and other prevalent standards, IB1 uses US English in its technical specifications and technical documentation._

## Data Catalog Entries

Data Catalog Entries specify the Roles and License with the terms:

`ib1:roleRequiredToAccess`
: The URL of an `ib1:Role` in the Registry whose members may access this data source, subject to the License specified in the `dcterms:license` term. Where multiple roles are specified, a client must have at least one of the roles to access the dataset. Unless the data has an `ib1:sensitivityClass` which allows access without authentication, at least one Role must be specified.

[dcterms:license](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#license)
: The URL of an `ib1:License`. All use of this data source is subject to the terms specified by this License.


## Scheme Catalog Requirements

Scheme Catalog Requirements resources specify the rules for a resource with the term:

`ib1:roleRequiredToPublish`
: The URL of the `ib1:Role` which is permitted to publish a Catalog entry conforming to this standard. If multiple Roles are specified, any of those Roles may publish a catalog entry.

In addition, the `ib1:RequiredMetadata` bnode will include `ib1:roleRequiredToAccess` and `dcterms:license` terms, specifying required access roles and license for conforming catalog entries.


## Examples

### Data Catalog Entry

```
<https://data.example.com/supply-voltage/v0>
    a dcat:DataService ;
	# ...
    ib1:roleRequiredToAccess <https://registry.core.trust.ib1.org/scheme/electricity/role/report-provider> ;
    ib1:roleRequiredToAccess <https://registry.core.trust.ib1.org/scheme/electricity/role/archiver> ;
    dcterms:license <https://registry.core.trust.ib1.org/scheme/electricity/license/voltage-reporting/2024-09-12> ;
.
```

These rules specify that members of either the "Report Provider" and "Archivers" roles may access the data with the Scheme's Voltage Reporting license.

### Scheme Catalog Requirements

```
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix dcat: <http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#> . 
@prefix ib1: <https://registry.core.trust.ib1.org/ns/1.0#> .

<https://registry.core.trust.ib1.org/scheme/electricity/standard/supply-voltage/2024-10-23>
		a ib1:SchemeCatalogRequirements ;
	ib1:roleRequiredToPublish <https://registry.core.trust.ib1.org/scheme/electricity/role/generator> ;
	ib1:requiredMetadata [ a ib1:RequiredMetadata ;
	    ib1:roleRequiredToAccess <https://registry.core.trust.ib1.org/scheme/electricity/role/network-operator> ;
	    ib1:roleRequiredToAccess <https://registry.core.trust.ib1.org/scheme/electricity/role/report-provider> ;
	];
.
```

This API definition requires the "Generator" role to publish an implementation of the API, and one of the "Network operator" or "Report provider" roles to access the API.
