# Open Data Publication

This specification defines how Data Providers publish Open Data within a Scheme using the standard metadata format described in the [Data Catalog Records](../data-catalog-records/1.0.md) specification, and the requirement for an enforcement policy. It ensures that published datasets are openly licensed, publicly accessible, and appropriately described for discovery in the catalog.

_Note: This document uses US English. To align with W3C and other prevalent standards, IB1 uses US English in its technical specifications and technical documentation._

## RDF Prefixes

This specification uses the following prefixes:

```
  dcat:    http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#
  dcterms: http://purl.org/dc/terms/
  ib1:     https://registry.trust.ib1.org/ns/1.0#
```

## Dependencies

A Scheme using this specification must also adopt the following specifications:

 * [Data Catalog Records](../data-catalog-records/1.0.md) (1.0 or later)
 * [Generic Sensitivity Classes](../generic-sensitivity-classes/1.0.md) (1.0 or later)


## Publication Requirements

To publish open data in a Trust Framework's Open Data Catalog:

 * Metadata files must be published as [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/) RDF resources, extended by the [Data Catalog Records](../data-catalog-records/1.0.md) Specification, in one of the supported serialization formats (Turtle, RDF/XML, or JSON-LD), and served with the correct `Content-Type` header.
 * These files must be hosted at publicly accessible URLs with no access control.
 * The URLs of these metadata files must be added to the Directory by the Member.
 
Data Catalog Entries will only be accepted by the Directory if:

 * Data Catalog Entries meet the requirements of this Specification.
 * The `dcterm:publisher` term has a value which matches the URL of the Member who listed the metadata URL in the Directory.
 * The Member has joined the Trust Framework's Open Data Scheme by executing the required Agreements.


## Licensing

All datasets published under this specification must be licensed using an open license which meets the [Open Definition 2.1](https://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/).

The license must be declared in the `dcterms:license` field, using the generally agreed URL for the license.


## Mandatory Metadata Fields

The following fields must be included in each DCAT resource representing a dataset:

[dcterms:license](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#license)
: A URL pointing to a license that meets the Open Definition 2.1.

[dcterms:publisher](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#publisher)
: A URL of the Data Providerâ€™s Member record in the Directory. This may be included in addition to any other publishers.

[dcterms:conformsTo](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#conformsTo)
: If the dataset conforms to a Scheme standard, the URL of the Scheme Catalog Requirements Document. Inclusion of this field may impose additional metadata requirements.

[ib1:dataSchema](https://registry.trust.ib1.org/ns/1.0#dataSchema)
: A URL pointing to a schema that describes the structure of the dataset (e.g., JSON Schema, XSD, or CSVW), unless it is commerically impractical to provide a schema. If the entry has a `dcterms:confirmsTo` value and this refers to a Scheme Catalog Requirements Document which specifies a schema, the value of this term must be the schema required by the Scheme standard.

[ib1:sensitivityClass](https://registry.trust.ib1.org/ns/1.0#sensitivityClass)
: Must be set to exactly `https://registry.trust.ib1.org/sensitivity-class/IB1-O`, indicating Open Data according to the [Generic Sensitivity Classes](../generic-sensitivity-classes/1.0.md) specification.

[ib1:trustFramework](https://registry.trust.ib1.org/ns/1.0#trustFramework)
: The URL of the Trust Framework under which this data is published.

[ib1:scheme](https://registry.trust.ib1.org/ns/1.0#scheme)
: The URL of the Scheme governing the publication and use of this dataset.

Any other metadata fields defined as mandatory in the [Data Catalog Records](../data-catalog-records/1.0.md) specification must also be included.


## Enforcement Policy

A Scheme which permits Open Data publication must define an enforcement policy for its rules, including:

 * How violations (e.g., incorrect licensing, misleading metadata) are reported and handled.
 * The process for removing non-compliant data from the catalog.
 * Criteria for auditing data quality and adherence to the Scheme Catalog Requirements.
 * A method to handle disputes or clarifications about licensing or conformance.

This Policy must be published in the Registry, with a `ib1:policyPurpose` of `https://registry.trust.ib1.org/open-data/policy-purpose/open-data-enforcement`
