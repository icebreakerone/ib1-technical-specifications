# Assured Open Data Publication

This specification defines additional metadata and policy requirements for the publication of Assured Open Data within a Scheme. It builds on the [Open Data Publication](../open-data/1.0.md) and [Data Catalog Records](../data-catalog-records/1.0.md) specifications by introducing dataset assurance levels and control over the licenses used for datasets.

_Note: This document uses US English. To align with W3C and other prevalent standards, IB1 uses US English in its technical specifications and technical documentation._

## RDF Prefixes

This specification uses the following prefixes:

```
  dcat:    http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#
  dcterms: http://purl.org/dc/terms/
  ib1:     https://registry.trust.ib1.org/ns/1.0#
```

## Dependencies

A Scheme using this specification must also adopt the following specifications:

 * [Data Catalog Records](../data-catalog-records/1.0.md) (1.0 or later)
 * [Generic Sensitivity Classes](../generic-sensitivity-classes/1.0.md) (1.0 or later)
 * [Open Data Publication](../open-data/1.0.md) (1.0 or later)

It is recommended that the Scheme uses common vocabulary and definitions from the following specifications:

 * [Generic Dataset Assurance Levels](../generic-dataset-assurance-levels/1.0.md) (1.0)


## Metadata

Each dataset must include an `ib1:datasetAssurance` term.

The value of this term must be a URL identifying a dataset assurance level defined in a specification adopted by the Scheme. Where the Scheme adopts [Generic Dataset Assurance Levels](../generic-dataset-assurance-levels/1.0.md), the value must be one of the defined URLs in that specification.

The requirements associated with the selected assurance level must be met.

If this field is not present, the dataset is not considered assured. The handling of unassured open datasets is outside the scope of this specification.


## License Validation

Each Scheme using this specification must publish a machine readable Open Data Allowed Licenses policy using an `ib1:Policy` resource in the Registry.

This policy must have:

* `ib1:policyPurpose`  
  `https://registry.trust.ib1.org/assured-open-data/policy-purpose/allowed-licenses`

* One or more `ib1:allowedLicense` fields, each containing the URL of an approved license.

The license used in the `dcterms:license` field of each dataset must match one of the values listed in this policy.

The Directory will reject datasets where the license is not explicitly allowed by the policy.
