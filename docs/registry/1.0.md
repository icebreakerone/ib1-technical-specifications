# Registry Structure

The Registry is the machine-readable description of the Trust Framework and the Schemes within it as a linked set of RDF Resources describing the component parts. It describes the rules and the technical standards that are used to exchange data between participants.

These RDF resources are made available using three formats, RDF/XML, Turtle, and JSON-LD, along with a human readable interpretation. Each resource has a URL that is the unique identifier, and if visited in a web browser, will show the human readable interpretation of what the resource represents.

The resource URLs are embedded in the data, metadata, and audit records. To preserve the meaning of these records, once created, a Scheme should adopt a method of versioning resources.


## RDF Prefixes

This specification uses the following prefixes:

```
  rdf:     http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#
  rdfs:    http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#
  ib1:     https://registry.trust.ib1.org/ns/1.0#
```


## Trust Framework Description

### ib1:TrustFramework

An `ib1:TrustFramework` resource describes an IB1 Trust Framework.

`rdfs:label`
: The abbreviated name or acronym of the Trust Framework, used as a symbol to identify the Trust Framework in URL paths and hostnames.

`rdfs:comment`
: The full human readable name of the Trust Framework.


### ib1:Scheme

An `ib1:Scheme` resource describes a Scheme within a Trust Framework.

`rdfs:label`
: The abbreviated name or acronym of the Scheme, used as a symbol to identify the Scheme in URL paths.

`rdfs:comment`
: The full human readable name of the Scheme.

`ib1:trustFramework`
: The URL of the Trust Framework to which this Scheme belongs.


### ib1:TechnicalProfile

An `ib1:TechnicalProfile` lists the technical specifications that are used by a Trust Framework or Scheme.

As Schemes are generally interoperable, the Trust Framework will specify a Technical Profile, and each Scheme's Technical Profile will generally be a superset of the Trust Framework's Technical Profile.

`rdfs:label`
: An abbreviated name for the Technical Profile.

`rdfs:comment`
: The full human readable name of the Technical Profile.

`ib1:trustFramework`
: The URL of the Trust Framework.

`ib1:Scheme`
: If this is a Scheme Technical Profile, the URL of the Scheme. `ib1:trustFramework` must be present and match the `ib1:trustFramework` of the `ib1:Scheme` resource.

`ib1:uses`
: One or more URLs of a technical specification that is used by a Trust Framework or Scheme.



## Common terms

Registry resources all use common terms to identify the resource within a Scheme.

`rdfs:label`
: A short identifier for the resource, typically used in the path of the resource URL.

`rdfs:comment`
: A human readable description of the resource.

`ib1:trustFramework`
: The URL of the Trust Framework which governs this resource.

`ib1:scheme`
: The URL of the Scheme which governs this resource.


## Scheme Description

Scheme description resources describe the elements within that Scheme.

All scheme description resources use the common terms.


### ib1:Role

An `ib1:Role` identifies a member's Role within the Scheme.

As the URL is used to identify this Role in long lived data structures, any versioning scheme must not change the URL.


### ib1:Agreement

An `ib1:Agreement` represents a legal agreement which may be executed by Scheme members. Execution is recorded in the Directory.

`ib1:agreementText`
: The URL of a human readable document with the text of the agreement. The document should be managed by the Registry publication process.


### ib1:Policy

An `ib1:Policy` represents a policy which the Scheme members must follow. All Policies in the Registry apply to all members of the Scheme.

`ib1:policyText`
: The URL of a human readable document with the text of the policy. The document should be managed by the Registry publication process.


## Scheme Identifiers

Identifiers are used within Scheme specific technical specifications and APIs. Their identifiers should be URLs within the Registry wherever possible, and use classes defined in the `ib1:` namespace where these apply.

As identifier URLs are used in long lived data structures, any versioning scheme must not change the URLs.

All identifiers use the common terms.


### ib1:SourceType

An identifier to describe the type of source of data.


### ib1:DatasetAssuranceLevel

An identifier for an Assurance Level.


### ib1:SensitivityClassRequirement

An identifier for a technical requirement for data within a given sensitivity class. Where possible, Schemes should use the identifiers defined in the `ib1:` namespace.


### ib1:SensitivityClass

An identifier for a Sensitivity Class, with a description of the technical requirements when processing data in this class.

`ib1:sensitivityClassRequirement`
: Zero or more `ib1:SensitivityClassRequirement` URLs.
