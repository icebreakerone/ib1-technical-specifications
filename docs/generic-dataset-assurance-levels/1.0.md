# Generic Dataset Assurance Levels

Trust Framework members can indicate the level of assurance in a dataset by describing it with an Assurance Level.

This specification defines generic Assurance Levels, identified by URLs in the IB1 Root Registry with the `https://registry.trust.ib1.org/dataset-assurance-level/` prefix.


## Dataset Assurance Level 1

`https://registry.trust.ib1.org/dataset-assurance-level/Level1`

Assurance that:

 * The metadata is available publicly on the web in a location recorded in the organisation’s IB1 Registry entry
 * Both metadata and underlying data use a machine-readable format
 * The dataset contains no personal data and is not subject to GDPR
 * For Open Data
    * The dataset is published on the web with a licence that is compatible with Open Data
    * The metadata specifies IB1-O for the Data Sensitivity Class
 * For Shared Data
    * The metadata specifies the access conditions for the data
    * The metadata specifies IB1-SA or IB1-SB for the Data Sensitivity Class

## Dataset Assurance Level 2

`https://registry.trust.ib1.org/dataset-assurance-level/Level2`

The dataset meets all the requirements of Level 1, plus assurance that:

 * Legal
    * Metadata includes definitions of usage rights for derived data (e.g. a URL to the conditions for derived data)
    * Metadata includes commercially reasonable citations and/or provenance
    * Metadata includes definitions of potential risks (e.g. a URL to such a definition) 
    * Where relevant or required, ensure privacy issues addressed within the published data and the data publication mechanism(s)
 * Practical
    * Metadata includes dates of creation and publication 
    * Where a dataset covers a temporal range, this is defined in the metadata
    * That the dataset will be maintained and available for a minimum of one calendar year
 * Technical
    * Data is published in content-appropriate formats that enable data to be used in an interoperable manner by machine-based systems
    * For Shared Data, the dataset is immediately available via a FAPI endpoint to any IB1 Trust Framework-registered application that meets the terms of that Trust Framework implementation.
 * Social
    * Data is documented on publicly available URLs
    * A mechanism is available for people to provide feedback and ask questions (e.g. human technical support)

## Dataset Assurance Level 3

`https://registry.trust.ib1.org/dataset-assurance-level/Level3`

The dataset meets all the requirements of Level 2, plus assurance that:

 * Practical
    * A schedule is published at a public URL documenting the process of maintaining the data’s availability
    * Commercially reasonable backups are in place
    * A document is published at a public URL detailing the process or data collection, curation, quality assurance and publishing
 * Technical
    * Inclusion in the metadata of citation(s) to, the underlying [open standard(s)](https://standards.theodi.org/introduction/what-are-open-standards-for-data/) used in publishing content-appropriate data is published in machine-readable format(s)
    * Publication of a single consistent URL, or clear rules for how URLs are constructed, are made to access the dataset
machine-readable metadata describing the contents of the dataset is provided (e.g. [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), [CSVW](https://csvw.org/))
where data is provided by an API, the API has a machine-readable definition (e.g. [OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html))
    * Assurance that the dataset has availability of at least 99.5%.


## Dataset Assurance Level 4

`https://registry.trust.ib1.org/dataset-assurance-level/Level4`

The dataset meets all the requirements of Level 3, plus assurance that:

 * Legal
    * The licence terms themselves are machine-readable and available at a persistent URL in a consistent manner  
 * Practical
    * Quality parameters and processes shall be published in a machine-readable format at a persistent URL in a consistent manner 
 * Technical
    * Provenance shall be published in a machine-readable format at a persistent URL in a consistent manner 
    * URIs shall be used as identifiers within data
    * The dataset has availability of at least 99.9%
