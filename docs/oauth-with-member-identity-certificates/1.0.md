# OAuth with Member Identity Certificates

TEXT FROM MTLS DOC:
The client certificate will be used to identify the client in the OAuth process with the clientâ€™s DIrectory URL as the OAuth client_id. This avoids the indirection of mapping a unguessable client_id to the Directory URL throughout the process. There is no need for the client_id to be secret where the client is identified by a client certificate within a MTLS transport.
