# Machine-Readable Data Licenses

The Registry contains the text of data licenses as machine-readable RDF documents. This approach differs from referring to a license with a unique identifier, or a machine-readable interpretations of a license, as the RDF document is the actual license used in a legal agreement.

To execute a license, the Registry URL is included in a digitally signed data structure passed between Members.

This specification is an intermediate step towards fully machine executable licenses. It provides a useful step towards the final goal, while being acceptable to corporate legal departments.

Once published in the Registry, the license and linked files are immutable, apart from metadata needed for versioning which does not change the meaning of the license.

_Note: This document uses US English. To align with W3C and other prevalent standards, IB1 uses US English in its technical specifications and technical documentation._

## RDF Prefixes

This specification uses the following prefixes:

```
  rdf:     http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#
  rdfs:    http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#
  ib1:     https://registry.trust.ib1.org/ns/1.0#
```

## License RDF class

The License RDF document must have an `rdf:type` of `ib1:License`.


## License RDF terms

In addition to terms which describe metadata for the Registry, Trust Framework and Scheme, the license contains terms which form the terms of the legal agreement.

`rdfs:label`
: The name of the license as a short symbol, typically included in the URL of the license.

`rdfs:comment`
: The full human readable name of the license.

`ib1:licenseTerms`
: The URL of a text document in the Registry which contains the legal text of the license. This text is the "glue" which turns the terms in the RDF document into a legally valid license. It refers to the terms in this RDF document to form the license. The document must be immutable once added to the Registry.

`ib1:licenseDuration`
: If referred to in the `ib1:licenseTerms`, the duration that the license is in force, as a structured string with the format `"<count> <unit>"`. `<count>` is an integer expressed as a string, and `<unit>` is one of `day`, `days`, `month`, `months`, `year`, `years`.

`ib1:permittedUse`
: If referred to in the `ib1:licenseTerms`, zero or more terms which describe the permitted use of the licensed data. Each standalone permitted use must be in a separate term.

`ib1:additionalCondition`
: If referred to in the `ib1:licenseTerms`, zero or more additional conditions which apply to the use of licensed data.

`ib1:permissionText`
: If referred to in the `ib1:licenseTerms`, and applicable to the use of the license, the URL of a text document in the Registry which contains the text to be displayed when asking the end user for their permission to transfer data between Members.
